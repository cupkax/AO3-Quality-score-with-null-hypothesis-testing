# AO3-Quality-score-with-null-hypothesis-testing
Improves upon an existing script which used null hypothesis testing to improve the kudos-hits ratio.

This version fixes the script to work for the new AO3 layout and replaces delimiter to non-eu standards.

TODO: Test the script with lower ```null_hyp``` values to check how it reflects the score.
